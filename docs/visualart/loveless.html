        <h2>Loveless Zine</h2>
        <p> 
            During my second year at college, a couple of students and I got together to work on a zine and distribute on campus.
            The first issue focused on concepts of love. 
            The color cover was designed in Clip Studio Paint and Adobe Illustrator.
